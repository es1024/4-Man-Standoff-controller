4-Man-Standoff-controller
=========================
See http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/35988/four-man-standoff for details on the competition.

Using the controller:
-----------------------
Your bot should be placed in players/BotName/

	1. Download source
	2. Add your bot to the list in src/main.cpp. There must be at least four players or the controller will crash, so use WhatsHappening (always does nothing) if needed.
	3. Compile the controller.
	4. Run the controller.
